# About best practices
> The only way to go fast is to go well

Development at Novoda is based on producing well-written code. 

The clearer code you write, the easier it is for everyone to read, understand, and maintain. Therefore, writing readable code should be a top priority for each and every developer since reading code occupies a much larger percentage of a developer’s time than writing it.

> “Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write.”
― Robert C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship

Going hand in hand with reading code is reviewing code. Every good developer should be able to review code and offer constructive feedback as well as address comments on its own work. Reviewing code during the [pull request process](https://blog.github.com/2015-01-21-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/) is an essential best practices of any team and helps avoid possible bugs and keeps the team working for the same clean code goal. 

> “Clean code is not written by following a set of rules. You don’t become a software craftsman by learning a list of heuristics. Professionalism and craftsmanship come from values that drive disciplines.”
― Robert C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship

By becoming a better and more effective coder, you’ll be able  to produce  high-quality software products that are easy to read and maintain. You will become a professional developer who codes at its best and there is no excuse to ever do anything else but your best.  

A good introduction to writing great code is **Clean Code** by Robert C Martin. This book will give you a deeper understanding of how and why we code the way we do at Novoda.

## Literature

If you have already read **Clean Code**, perhaps you want to refresh your memory or pick one of other options below:

* **Effective Java** by Joshua Bloch
* **App Architecture** by Objc.io
* **Clean Architecture** by Robert C. Martin


## Guidelines

Some guidelines for making the most of feedback and learning in this part of the NCU include: 

* Apply your learnings to a piece of code: for instance you could contribute new code, or find some code  you are not familiar with and look for areas to improve.
* Your colleagues should have easy access to your work: prefer to have your contributions on a hosted repo, for example GitHub or BitBucket. 
* Ensure someone viewing your work can easily understand what you’re trying to achieve: document your goal as part of your work.
* The code should look familiar to your reviewers: ensure you follow Novoda’s style guidelines (see [novoda/styles-guides](https://github.com/novoda/novoda/tree/master/style-guides)).
* Progress should be iterative and well documented: you should issue at least one PR that someone else should review with a [clear commit history](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
* You should share back what you learned: you can pick a format between a Hack & Tell, blog post, kata, or workshop.

Remember, your buddy can always help you with any of the points above.

## Progress log

- [x] Read Clean Code or another book if applicable

- [x] Made a pull request and had someone review it
- [x] Responded to the feedback of others
- [x] Presented back to Novoda on the learnings
- [x] Try to attend a kata (if you’ve not been in one yet, ask your buddy to run one!)
